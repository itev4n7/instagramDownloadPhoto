In the project i used libraries such as:

- owner
- j2html
- c3p0

# Used patterns in the project: page object & page factory, builder, singleton
In the project i work with:
- webdriver(selenuim/selenide/selenoid)
- building xpath locators
- database and sql
- jenkins & mariadb & selenoid & reportportal is spin up in docker
- parallel test methods(testNG features)
- parallel connection to database 

# Made a maven plugin(https://github.com/itev4n7/blobtohtml-maven-plugin)

I stick to the SOLID rule -> Single responsibility
